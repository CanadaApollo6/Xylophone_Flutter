# Xylophone Flutter App
This app is a basic flutter app and serves as a simple exercise for importing audio assets into flutter and getting them to play on user command. It has a basic and multi-coloured UI which gives the clear implication that we are examining a simple xylophone, similar to one you might have seen in elementary school.
